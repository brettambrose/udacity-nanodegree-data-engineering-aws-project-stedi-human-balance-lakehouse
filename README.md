## Project Details
The STEDI Team has been hard at work developing a hardware STEDI Step Trainer that:
* trains the user to do STEDI balance
* and has sensors on the device that collect data to train a machine-learning algorithm to detect steps;
* has a companion mobile app that collects customer data and interacts with the device sensors.

STEDI has heard from millions of early adopters who are willing to purchase the STEDI Step Trainers and use them.

Several customers have already received their Step Trainers, installed the mobile application, and begun using them together to test their balance. The Step Trainer is just a motion sensor that records the distance of the object detected. The app uses a mobile phone accelerometer to detect motion in the X, Y, and Z directions.

The STEDI team wants to use the motion sensor data to train a machine learning model to detect steps accurately in real-time. Privacy will be a primary consideration in deciding what data can be used.

Some of the early adopters have agreed to share their data for research purposes. Only these customersâ€™ Step Trainer and accelerometer data should be used in the training data for the machine learning model.

## Project Summary
Extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model.

## Project Environment

### AWS Environment

Data from the STEDI Step Trainer and mobile app will be used to develop a lakehouse solution in the cloud that curates the data for the machine learning model using:

* Python and Spark
* AWS Glue
* AWS Athena
* AWS S3

### Github Environment

This github repository will store the SQL scripts and Python code used in the project.

### Workflow Environment Configuration

Python scripts are created using AWS Glue and Glue Studio. These web-based tools and services contain multiple options for editors to write or generate Python code that uses PySpark. The code used in these editors will be saved into this repository.

## Project Datasets

**STEDI** has three [JSON data sources](https://github.com/udacity/nd027-Data-Engineering-Data-Lakes-AWS-Exercises/tree/main/project/starter) to use from the Step Trainer
* customer
* step_trainer
* accelerometer

To download this data...
1. Go to the [nd027-Data-Engineering-Data-Lakes-AWS-Exercises](https://github.com/udacity/nd027-Data-Engineering-Data-Lakes-AWS-Exercises/tree/main) repository and Download ZIP.

![ZIP Download Istructions](/images/2025-04-26%2011_47_13-udacity_nd027-Data-Engineering-Data-Lakes-AWS-Exercises_%20Exercise%20starter%20and%20so.png)

2. Extract the zip file
3. Navigate to **project/starter** in the extracted repo to find the JSON data files within three sub-fulders, which includes:
    * 956 rows in the customer_landing table,
    * 81273 rows in the accelerometer_landing table, and
    * 28680 rows in the step_trainer_landing table

## Project Requirements

![Wofklow Diagram](/images/2025-04-26%2012_00_44-STEDI%20Human%20Balance%20Analytics%20-%20Project%20Instructions.png)

To simulate data coming from the various sources, create S3 directories for:
* customer_landing
* step_trainer_landing
* accelerometer_landing

Create **three Glue tables** for each of the three landing zones above.

Query those tables using **Athena** and take a screenshot of each table's result set, save each screenshot as:
* customer_landing(.png,.jpeg, etc.)
* step_trainer_landing(.png,.jpeg, etc.)
* accelerometer_landing(.png,.jpeg, etc.)

Preliminary analysis by the Data Science team determined that the **Accelerometer Records** each match one of the **Customer Records**.

Create two AWS Glue Jobs that do the following:
1. Sanitize the Customer data from the Website (Landing Zone) and only store the Customer Records who agreed to share their data for research purposes (Trusted Zone) - creating a Glue Table called **customer_trusted**.
2. Sanitize the Accelerometer data from the Mobile App (Landing Zone) - and only store Accelerometer Readings from customers who agreed to share their data for research purposes (Trusted Zone) - creating a Glue Table called **accelerometer_trusted**.
3. Validate the Glue job is successful and only contains Customer Records from people who agreed to share their data. 
4. Query the Glue customer_trusted table with Athena and take a screenshot of the data. Name the screenshot customer_trusted(.png,.jpeg, etc.).

The Data Science team also discovered data quality issues with the Customer Data.  Each STEDI Step Trainer purchased by a customer has a unique **serial number**.  However, a defect on the fulfillment website resulted in the same 30 serial numbers being assigned to millions of customers. Only a small subset of customers have received their Step Trainers so far, but they are submitting Step Trainer data over the IoT Network (Landing Zone).  Fortunately, the Step Trainer records contain the correct serial numbers.  The challenge is now associating customers to Step Trainers.

To remediate the data quality issue:

1. **Write a Glue job** that sanitizes the Customer data (Trusted Zone) and creates a Glue Table (Curated Zone) that only includes customers who have accelerometer data and have agreed to share their data for research called **customers_curated.**

Finally, write **two Glue jobs** that do the following tasks:

1. Read the Step Trainer IoT data stream (S3) and populate a Trusted Zone Glue Table called **step_trainer_trusted** that contains the Step Trainer Records data for customers who have accelerometer data and have agreed to share their data for research (customers_curated).

2. Create an aggregated table that has each of the Step Trainer Readings, and the associated accelerometer reading data for the same timestamp, but only for customers who have agreed to share their data, and make a glue table called **machine_learning_curated.**

See the ERD below to understand the desired state.

## Testing and Validation Steps

For stage of developing the lakehouse, the following row counts should be in each table:

* Landing
    * Customer: 956
    * Accelerometer: 81273
    * Step Trainer: 28680
* Trusted
    * Customer: 482
    * Accelerometer: 40981
    * Step Trainer: 14460
* Curated
    * Customer: 482
    * Machine Learning: 43681

**HINT:** Use Transform - SQL Query nodes whenever possible.  Other node types my give unexpected results.  For example, rather than a Join node, use a SQL node that has two parents, then join them through a SQL query.

## Infrastructure Setup

**NOTE:** The instructions below are for manual setup through the AWS Console. These can be skipped by deploying infrastructure via Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with the following steps:

1. adding AWS credentials to [lakehouse.cfg](/lakehouse.cfg)
2. executing [infra_deploy.py](/infra_deploy.py)

### Create S3 Bucket

Buckets are storage locations within AWS, that have a hierarchical directory-like structure. Once you create an S3 bucket, you can create as many sub-directories, and files as you want. The bucket is the "parent" of all of these directories and files.

Using the AWS CLI input the following command:

```aws s3 mb s3://stedi-lakehouse-ba```

### Describe Available VPCs

This cloud project runs resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).  Glue jobs will run in a secure zone without access to anything outside the virtual network.

Using the AWS CLI input the following command:

```aws ec2 describe-vpcs```

This should return something like this:

<pre>{
    "Vpcs": [
        {
            "OwnerId": "261621541097",
            "InstanceTenancy": "default",
            "CidrBlockAssociationSet": [
                {
            "CidrBlockAssociationSet": [
                {
                {
                {
                    "AssociationId": "vpc-cidr-assoc-089fbaac9d220fbf5",
                    "CidrBlock": "172.31.0.0/16",
                    "CidrBlockState": {
                        "State": "associated"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "IsDefault": true,
            "BlockPublicAccessStates": {
                "InternetGatewayBlockMode": "off"
            },
            "VpcId": "vpc-0211404bc2a15d3e7",
            "State": "available",
            "CidrBlock": "172.31.0.0/16",
            "DhcpOptionsId": "dopt-0ca67292028043518"
        }
    ]
}</pre>


### Describe Available Route Tables
A routing table is an entity that stores the network paths to various locations.  In this project, the routing table will store the path to S3 from within the VPC.  A routing table is required to configure with the VPC Gateway used in this project.

In the AWS CLI input the following command:

```aws ec2 describe-route-tables```

This should return something like this:

<pre>
{
    "RouteTables": [
        {
            "Associations": [
                {
                    "Main": true,
                    "RouteTableAssociationId": "rtbassoc-0cdf19a5a21f95cf3",
                    "RouteTableId": "rtb-0faab5ee2c9e05110",
                    "AssociationState": {
                        "State": "associated"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "PropagatingVgws": [],
            "RouteTableId": "rtb-0faab5ee2c9e05110",
            "Routes": [
                {
                    "DestinationCidrBlock": "172.31.0.0/16",
                    "GatewayId": "local",
                    "Origin": "CreateRouteTable",
                    "State": "active"
                },
                {
                    "DestinationCidrBlock": "0.0.0.0/0",
                    "GatewayId": "igw-0720c7075dadd2fdf",
                    "Origin": "CreateRoute",
                    "State": "active"
                }
            ],
            "Tags": [],
            "VpcId": "vpc-0211404bc2a15d3e7",
            "OwnerId": "261621541097"
        }
    ]
}</pre>

### Create VPC Gateway with S3 Gateway Endpoint

A VPC Gateway is a network entity that gives access to outside networks and resources. S3 will not initially reside in the available VPC.  An S3 Gateway Endpoint will be required to establish a secure connection between the VPC and S3. Once the endpoint is created, the Glue jobs (or any other resource within the VPC) will have a network path to reach S3.

Two steps:
1. Using the **VpcId** retrieved in the [Describe Available VPCs](#describe-available-vpcs) step and the **RouteTableId** [Describe Available Route Tables](#describe-available-route-tables) step,
2. Input the following command in the AWS CLI:

```aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint --vpc-id vpc-0211404bc2a15d3e7 --service-name com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3 --route-table-ids rtb-0faab5ee2c9e05110```

This should return something like this:

<pre>{
    "VpcEndpoint": {
        "VpcEndpointId": "vpce-0336baba747e61d9b",
        "VpcEndpointType": "Gateway",
        "VpcId": "vpc-0211404bc2a15d3e7",
        "ServiceName": "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3",
        "State": "available",
        "PolicyDocument": "{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":\"*\",\"Action\":\"*\",\"Resource\":\"*\"}]}",
        "RouteTableIds": [
            "rtb-0faab5ee2c9e05110"
        ],
        "SubnetIds": [],
        "Groups": [],
        "PrivateDnsEnabled": false,
        "RequesterManaged": false,
        "NetworkInterfaceIds": [],
        "DnsEntries": [],
        "CreationTimestamp": "2025-04-26T17:26:38+00:00",
        "OwnerId": "261621541097"
    }</pre>


### Create Glue Service Role

AWS uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to manage users, and roles (which can be reused by users and services). A Service Role in IAM is a Role that is used by an AWS Service to interact with cloud resources.

Using the AWS CLI input the following command (including the policy):


<pre>aws iam create-role --role-name my-glue-service-role --assume-role-policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
         {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": {
                 "Service": "glue.amazonaws.com"
             },
             "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
         }
     ]
 }'</pre>

 This will return something like this:
 
 <pre>{
    "Role": {
        "Path": "/",
        "RoleName": "my-glue-service-role",
        "RoleId": "AROATZ2O35DU272SHMC5Y",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::261621541097:role/my-glue-service-role",
        "CreateDate": "2025-04-26T17:46:28+00:00",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Service": "glue.amazonaws.com"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}</pre>

#### Grant Glue Privileges on S3 Bucket

Using the AWS CLI input the following command (including the policy):

<pre>aws iam put-role-policy --role-name my-glue-service-role --policy-name S3Access --policy-document '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ListObjectsInBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::stedi-lakehouse-ba"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllObjectActions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*Object",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::stedi-lakehouse-ba/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}'</pre>

#### Attach Glue Policy

<pre>aws iam put-role-policy --role-name my-glue-service-role --policy-name GlueAccess --policy-document '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
